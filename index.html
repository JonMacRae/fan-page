	  <main><h2>The Experience of Golf
		</h2>
		<p>
		 The game of golf is as polarizing as any! Golf provides some 
		 with a relaxing pastime while driving others to act out in fits of rage.
		 It is that polarization that makes the experience of golf such a fantastic topic. We will explore the good and the bad in more detail as we go.
		</p>
		 
		<h3 id="thebad"> The Bad
		</h3>
		 <p> Before we get into the beauty of the game, let's take a moment to appreciate the more entertaining list of the worst people to golf with.
		 </p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The <em>I didn't pass math class and can't keep track of my score </em>person.</li>
		  <li>The <em>I think I am better than I am </em>person.</li>
		  <li>The <em>always finds his ball guy</em> even thought it went in the pond.</li>
		  <li>The <em> sandbagging son of a bitch.</em></li>
		  <li>And finally we have the <em>foot wedge</em> guy who always improves his lie when no one is looking.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>The good
		</h3>
		 <p> Golf has the ability to bring the worst out in all of us, but if you can resist being one of <em> those guys,</em>  you will learn to truly experience the joys that the game has to offer. Let's take a look at the subtle feelings that golf can provide.

		<dt><strong>The long ball:</strong></dt>
  		<dd>This is the Quintessential image of a dominant golfer, impressing your friends and intimidating your opponents!</dd>
 		<dt><strong>The well struck Iron:</strong></dt>
 		<dd>The mark of an advanced golfer. These shots may not be as impressive as the 300 yard drive, but they do more for your score card and in the end they don't ask how you did it.  The feeling of hitting a green from 200 yards is second to none. </dd>
		<dt><strong>The 20 foot putt:</strong></dt>
 		<dd> While this is clearly the most dule of of the three to watch, Putting does more for your score card than any other shot. The mature golfer knows that these putts mean dollars in their pockets!</dd>
